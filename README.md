# CrisisTrend Analyzer – EDA

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on crisis and disaster management data to uncover insights related to disaster severity, response effectiveness, economic impact, and recovery patterns. The analysis focuses on understanding how response time, aid allocation, and disaster types influence casualties and recovery outcomes.

Key aspects studied include response delay levels, recovery days distribution, economic loss trends, casualty patterns, and response efficiency.
